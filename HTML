            India is a country with wide diversity, not only in terms of culture and language but also in 
            terms of dietary habits and nutritional needs. Each state in India has its own unique cuisine,
             influenced by factors such as geography, climate, culture, and availability of ingredients. 
             Here's a brief overview of nutrition and health considerations in different states of India and
              some general tips on how to maintain good health:
          </h1>
          <div class="box4">
            <p>
              Tamil Nadu: Tamil Nadu's cuisine is known for its variety of rice-based dishes like dosa, idli, and sambar. These foods are rich in carbohydrates and proteins, providing energy for daily activities. However, excessive consumption of refined grains and spicy foods may lead to digestive issues and weight gain.
              <br><br>
  Assam: Assamese cuisine includes a variety of rice-based dishes, along with fish, meat, and leafy greens. Fish is a staple protein source, while leafy greens like spinach and mustard greens provide essential vitamins and minerals. However, traditional cooking methods often involve liberal use of oil and spices, so it's important to practice moderation.
  <br><br>
  Rajasthan: Rajasthan's cuisine is influenced by its arid climate and limited availability of fresh vegetables. Dishes like dal baati churma and gatte ki sabzi are hearty and nutritious, providing a good balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. However, excessive consumption of fried foods and sweets should be avoided.
            </p>
      <div class="box3">
        <p>
          Punjab: Punjab is known for its rich and hearty cuisine, which includes dishes like sarson da saag, makki di roti, and tandoori chicken. These dishes are often high in calories, carbohydrates, and fats. While delicious, it's important to consume them in moderation to avoid weight gain and related health issues.
<br><br>
Kerala: Kerala's cuisine is largely influenced by its abundant coastal resources. Traditional dishes like fish curry, appam, and puttu are rich in seafood, coconut, and spices. These foods provide essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. However, coconut-based dishes can be high in saturated fats, so it's important to balance them with other nutritious foods.
<br><br>
West Bengal: Bengali cuisine is characterized by its use of fish, rice, and mustard oil. Fish is a rich source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health. However, excessive consumption of fried foods and sweets like roshogolla and mishti doi can contribute to health problems like obesity and diabetes.
<br><br>
Gujarat: Gujarati cuisine is predominantly vegetarian and includes dishes like dhokla, khichdi, and thepla. These foods are often high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals due to the use of ingredients like lentils, vegetables, and whole grains. However, some dishes may be high in oil and sugar, so it's important to make healthier choices.
